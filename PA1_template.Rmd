## Loading and processing the dataset "activity".

```{r}
Act_Mon <- read.csv("activity.csv")
head(Act_Mon,3, echo = TRUE)
```


## The data shows the mean total number of steps taken per day:

```{r}
It2 <- Act_Mon$interval
mean(It2)

```

## The histogram will show the total number of steps taken per day.  and the summary will display the mean and median of the data.

```{r}
It2 <- Act_Mon$interval

hist(It2)

```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
