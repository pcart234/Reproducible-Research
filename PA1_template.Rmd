```

## The histogram will show the total number of steps taken per day.  and the summary will display the mean and median of the data.

```{r}
It2 <- Act_Mon$interval

hist(It2)

```
## The summary function will display the mean and median of the data.

```{r}
It2 <- Act_Mon$interval

summary(It2)
```
